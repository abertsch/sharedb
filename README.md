## PII Classification

This repository contains some basic code that should ideally serve as the
foundation to a PII classification pipeline.
It's main components are

- Classifiers
- Removal techniques
- A pipeline to do the above
- A basic frontend

## Technical info

This project's requrements can be found in `requirements.txt`.
I suggest install them all in a virtual environment if possible.
