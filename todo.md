# Todo
A sample todo document.

## Overall
[] Better comments throughout the front end.

## DataHub integration
Here are tasks relating to integration with DataHub and databases in general.

[] Investigate whether my repo creation is broken or repo creation is broken in general.

[] ... and see if it's even possible to upload a file and convert it to a table via the API. Otherwise this may have to be done manually.

It looks like we can stream data from a table via SQL queries.

[] Updating DataHub tables with streamed SQL statement --- overlap it with other operation

## Frontend
Here are tasks related to the front end, which as this point is really just a glorified demo.

[] Move to a proper framework like React -- for UI design

[] Move off of Tornado and onto Django REST framework -- for backend (OAuth2 maybe the hardest part..)
