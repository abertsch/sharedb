# Todo
A sample todo document.

## Overall
[] Better comments throughout the front end.

## DataHub integration
Here are tasks relating to integration with DataHub and databases in general.

[] Build proper OAuth2 authorization.
[] Investigate whether my repo creation is broken or repo creation is broken in general.
[] ... and see if it's even possible to upload a file and convert it to a table via the API. Otherwise this may have to be done manually.

It looks like we can stream data from a table via SQL queries.

[] Updating DataHub tables with streamed SQL statement (oh god)

## Frontend
Here are tasks related to the front end, which as this point is really just a glorified demo.

[] Move to a proper framework like React
[] Move off of Tornado and onto Django (well, maybe, if you feel like it)
